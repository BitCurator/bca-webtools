External Tools

BitCurator Access Webtools relies on several libraries to provide access to forensically
packaged disk images. Some of these libraries built from source to ensure compatibility
and coverage.

This directory contains specific source tarballs that (for one reason or another) may no
longer be distributed by their original authors, or for which the canonical download links
tend to change.

See bootstrap.sh in the provision directory for current build procedures.

The 20140608 version of libewf (tested with Sleuthkit 4.6) has been included here for convenience.

You can find the current sources for libewf at
